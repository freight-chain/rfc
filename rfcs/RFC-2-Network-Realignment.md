## Simple Summary<br>
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the RFC.-->
The Network Token supply must be realigned to properly reflect the new business model for the network as a whole. Focusing on EDI transactions aligns the token-use case and network mechanics with actual product that customers are wanting and expressing interest in.<br>

## Abstract<br>
The finite supply of 88,000,000 tokens is unusable in an EDI focused product offering for network transactions. Simply put: The amount of transactions that the network can handle will be constrained by the supply of tokens based on current genesis file configuration. 
<br>
## Motivation
Based on current customers and potential customer interest in our cloud EDI offering, migrating to an edi focused product versus a "TMS" system with EDI functionality has lead to more interest in our product offering, and hence the network usability. EDI transactions make more sense than pursuing a TMS style offering as we currently are doing. EDI transactions are similar to blockchain transactions: they are charged per transaction and even per byte. This is exactly how Ethereum-like networks base their transaction sets to. Based on calculations of network growth size and current incentives for hosting a node, these may not be sufficient to payout to properly decentralize the network nor offer sufficient "at stake" economic incentive for economic mitigation against attacking the network (read: spamming the network). Fixing transaction (pegging) to DAI/USDC here is perferable and limits volatility while also encouraging price appreciation based on organic demand. <br>

## Specification<br>
Gas Limit per block: 10,485,760 (as defined in gensis file)<br>
EDI transaction size in bytes: 1,136<br>
EDI transaction cost in gas: 77,248<br>
EDI transactions per block: 135.74 <br>

Block Rewards
Rewards to halve every year for 25 years.

Year one: 31,556,952<br>
Year two: 15,778,476<br>
Year three: 7,889,238<br>
Year four: 3,944,619<br>
and so on.<br>

Network Hard Disk Growth per year at max transaction size:<br>
in bytes: 486615625005<br>
in gigabytes: 486.615625<br>

Tokens that will be needed for a payout starting at 10 per block at year one: 63,113,902.12<br>
Assuming full transaction blocks using numbers defined under `EDI` above: 428,358,824.8<br>
Current existing supply: 88,000,000<br>
<br>
New Max Supply: 579,472,727<br>
Floating Supply: 151,113,902<br>
Transaction Supply: 428,358,825<br>
<br>
Transaction Supply Sell Criteria: 1 $EDI = 1 $USDC/$DAI [SupplytxCriteria]<br>
The Transaction Supply would be sold after $EDI exceeds value of 1 $USDC/DAI.<br>
<br>
If $EDI is GREATER than 1 $USDC/DAI, Transaction Supply can be unlocked.<br>
If $EDI is LESS than 1 $USDC/DAI, Transaction Supply remains locked.<br>
Else $EDI not valid.<br>

Supply Transaction Criteria can be adjusted by committee approval. 

## Rationale
The rationale behind this is to enhance token utility: EDI transaction pricing is already done in the logistics industry on not only a per transactional level it also includes pricing based on bytes per message. 
<br>
## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All RFCs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The RFC must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. RFC submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
This would make $BOL in compatible with the network upgrade, hence needing to migrate to a new token called $EDI. 
<br>
## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for RFCs that are affecting consensus changes. Other RFCs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
Testing can be found in the [edi repo](https://github.com/freight-chain/edi/testing)<br>
documentation on testing and specifications can be found:<br>

[edi transaction standard](https://gist.github.com/sambacha/3bccb5af0dc834254df0935ba9cedb9c)<br>
<br>
## Implementation<br>
A new contract will be published, with ABI and source code published in the [edi token repo](https://github.com/freight-chain/network-token)
<br>
## Security Considerations<br>
Considerations related to security are by nature mitigated due to the "cost per transaction and per byte" nature of submitting transactions.
